## UiPath 

### Introduction

	The main types of supported projects are: 
- Sequences 

	- suitable to linear processes, enabling you to smoothly go from one activity to another, without cluttering your project. 

- Flowcharts 
	
	- suitable to a more complex business logic, enabling you to integrate decisions and connect activities in a more diverse manner, through multiple branching logic operators. 
	
- State Machines 

	- suitable for very large projects; they use a finite number of states in their execution which are triggered by a condition (transition) or activity.
